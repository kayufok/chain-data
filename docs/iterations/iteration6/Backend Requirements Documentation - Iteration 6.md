## Functional Requirements

### Batch Processing Components

#### Pre-Fetch Batch Job

- **Job Name:** EthereumPreFetchBatchProcessor
- **Schedule:** Configurable via cron expression (default: every 10 seconds)
- **Strategy:** Two-phase processing (Pre-fetch phase → Storage phase)


#### Processing Logic Flow

| Phase | Step | Description | Implementation |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Phase 1: Pre-Fetch** | 1.1 Initialize | Read next_block_number from chain_info table for Ethereum chain | Query chain_info where chain_id = "1" |
|  | 1.2 Create Batch | Generate list of block numbers to process | Create array of block numbers [current to current + batch_size] |
|  | 1.3 Parallel RPC Calls | Execute all RPC calls with controlled concurrency | Use WebFlux parallel processing with rate limiting |
|  | 1.4 Aggregate Results | Collect and deduplicate addresses from all blocks | Merge address sets from all successful RPC responses |
| **Phase 2: Storage** | 2.1 Bulk Address Insert | Store unique addresses in address table | Single bulk insert operation with conflict handling |
|  | 2.2 Bulk Relationship Insert | Create address-chain relationships | Bulk insert address_chain records |
|  | 2.3 Log Failures | Record any RPC failures | Insert failure records into api_call_failure_log |
|  | 2.4 Update Progress | Update next_block_number | Atomic update of chain_info table |

### API Endpoints

**Pre-Fetch Batch Status Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "jobStatus": "RUNNING",
    "currentPhase": "PREFETCH",
    "currentBlockNumber": 18500150,
    "blocksInBatch": 100,
    "rpcCallsCompleted": 65,
    "rpcCallsFailed": 2,

    "estimatedCompletionTime": "2024-01-01T00:03:00Z",
    "processingRate": "25 blocks/minute"
  }
}
```


### Business Logic Requirements

- **Validation Rules:**
    - Block numbers must be positive integers and sequential
    - Batch size must be between 1 and 1000
    - Concurrent RPC calls must be between 1 and 50
    - Rate limit must not exceed provider limits (1500 req/min)
- **Business Rules:**
    - **Phase 1**: Complete all RPC calls before any database writes
    - **Phase 2**: Process all collected data atomically
    - Store only unique addresses across the entire batch
    - Create address-chain relationships only for new combinations
    - Update next_block_number only after both phases complete
    - Log failures with detailed block-level error information
- **Data Processing:**

1. **Pre-Fetch Phase:**
        - Query chain_info.next_block_number for target chain
        - Create batch: [next_block_number, ..., next_block_number+batch_size-1]
        - Execute concurrent RPC calls with rate limiting
        - Collect addresses from successful responses into Set<String>
        - Track failed blocks for error logging
2. **Storage Phase:**
        - Bulk insert unique addresses: `INSERT INTO address ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`
        - Bulk insert address-chain relationships
        - Log all RPC failures to api_call_failure_log
        - Update chain_info.next_block_number atomically
- **External Integrations:**
    - **Ethereum RPC Service:** Reuse RPC client from US-002 with async capabilities
    - **Database Entities:** Use entities from US-003 with bulk operation support


## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements

- **Processing Speed:** Complete 100-block batch within 8 minutes (improved from sequential approach)
- **Concurrent RPC Calls:** Configurable concurrency (default: 10 concurrent calls)
- **Rate Limiting:** Maintain compliance with 1500 requests per minute

- **Database Performance:** Bulk operations to minimize DB roundtrips


### Reliability Requirements

- **Availability:** 99.5% uptime for batch processing service

    - Memory constraints: Graceful degradation with smaller batch sizes
- **Logging Strategy:**
    - INFO: Phase transitions, batch progress every 25 blocks, completion metrics
    - WARN: RPC timeouts, memory pressure warnings
    - ERROR: Database transaction failures, critical system errors

5. **Memory Monitor:** Component to track and manage memory usage during processing
6. **Rate Limiter:** Enhanced rate limiter supporting concurrent call distribution

### Data Flow

1. **Pre-Fetch Phase:**
    - Scheduler triggers batch job
    - Read next_block_number and create block range
    - Initialize concurrent RPC call executor
    - Execute RPC calls with rate limiting and concurrency control

SELECT unnest(?::text[]) 
ON CONFLICT (wallet_address) DO NOTHING;

// Bulk address-chain relationship insert
INSERT INTO address_chain (wallet_address_id, chain_id)
SELECT a.id, ? 
FROM address a 
WHERE a.wallet_address = ANY(?::text[])
ON CONFLICT (wallet_address_id, chain_id) DO NOTHING;

// Atomic progress update with batch info
UPDATE chain_info 
SET next_block_number = ?, 
    last_processed_timestamp = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    last_batch_size = ?
WHERE chain_id = ?;
```


### Memory Management Strategy

```java
// Configurable memory threshold monitoring
if (Runtime.getRuntime().totalMemory() > MEMORY_THRESHOLD) {
    // Reduce batch size or increase processing frequency
    // Log memory pressure warning
    // Consider graceful degradation
}
```

### 🏗️ **Technical Implementation Details**

#### **Concurrent Processing Architecture**
```java
// Phase 1: Concurrent RPC calls using CompletableFuture
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(maxConcurrentRpcCalls);
List<CompletableFuture<Void>> futures = blockNumbers.stream()
    .map(blockNumber -> CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> {
        Set<String> addresses = processBlockConcurrently(blockNumber);
        blockAddresses.put(blockNumber, addresses);
    }, executor))
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
CompletableFuture.allOf(futures.toArray(new CompletableFuture[0])).join();
```

#### **Two-Phase Processing Flow**
1. **Pre-Fetch Phase**: Collect all addresses from concurrent RPC calls
2. **Storage Phase**: Bulk insert addresses and relationships in single transaction

#### **Bulk Database Operations**
```java
// Bulk address insertion with duplicate handling
for (Address address : batch) {
    try {
        addressMapper.insert(address);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Handle duplicates gracefully
        Address existing = addressMapper.selectOne(queryWrapper);
        if (existing != null) {
            address.setId(existing.getId());
        }
    }
}
```

## Comments and Discussion

- Pre-fetch approach trades memory usage for improved throughput and reduced database transaction time
- Concurrent RPC calls require careful rate limiting distribution to avoid provider limits
- Memory monitoring is critical due to address accumulation during pre-fetch phase
- Future enhancement: Dynamic batch size adjustment based on available memory and RPC performance
- Consider implementing cache warming strategies for frequently accessed address data
